## Built with

* CSS (Flexbox and Grid
* HTML (Semantic HTML5 markup and BEM)
* Javascript
* Mobile-first workflow

## How it was the development process?

The application was created by using mobile-first concept. The first step I tried to make every element from the document fit in differents screens, for that I use breakpoints of **600px**, **800px**, **900px**, **1200px** and **1800px** for big screens. The media-queries were to fit in landscape and portrait screens on tablets, desktops, laptops, and big screens such as 4k and FullHD monitors or TVs. For the layout, I used Flexbox in the most cases and Grid for some specifics parts of the site. 

Javascript was used to hid and show modals with login pages and to work with data from the users with a login. 


## Future development

The application still missing some features that I'm still developing, some of them are:
* Connect an API to help finding the products
* Develop a chatbox with a bot
* Create a database

## What did I learn?
This project helped me fix the concepts of HTML, CSS and Javascript and help me gain more skills with code and designing UI.
